# Microwall Project Documentation

Microwall is a powerful web application built with Next.js that offers two distinct modes: Viewer and Editor. It empowers users to create interactive and presentational content using an intuitive interface. This documentation provides an overview of the project, its features, and how to set it up.

## Features

- **Viewer Mode**: Users can view interactive and presentational blocks created in the Editor Mode.
- **Editor Mode**: Users can create and manage interactive and presentational blocks.
- **Interactive Blocks**: Add blocks that respond to user interactions.
- **Presentational Blocks**: Create static blocks for informative content.
- **Material UI Integration**: Utilizes the Material UI library for a sleek and modern UI.
- **Redux Toolkit and Redux Persist**: State management and persistence for seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A powerful React framework for building server-rendered applications.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and maintainability.
- **Material UI**: A popular UI framework for creating beautiful, responsive, and accessible user interfaces.
- **Redux Toolkit**: A toolkit for efficient Redux development, making state management more predictable and maintainable.
- **Redux Persist**: Provides seamless state persistence across page reloads.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
